introduction:
  - "I'm a senior Computer Science student at Zhejiang University, pursuing an honors degree through the Chu Kochen Honors College."
  - "I currently work at Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) with Xudong Wang and Prof. Trevor Darrell, where we explore how to make multimodal systems more aligned, controllable, and grounded."
  - "Beyond research, I care about building open resources for the community and collaborating on projects that push creative applications of generative models."
