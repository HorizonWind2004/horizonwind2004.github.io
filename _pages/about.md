About Me
-----
I am a junior student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), pursuing a Bachelor of **Computer Science and Technology with an honors degree** from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn). I expect to receive my degree in June, 2026.

I am fortunate to be a research intern at Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) lab UC Berkeley, advised by [Xudong Wang](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~xdwang/) and Prof. [Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/). 

<!-- I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yi Yang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=RMSuNFwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and affiliated with the [ReLER Lab](https://reler.net/), working closely with and [Dr. Zongxin Yang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=8IE0CfwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Dewei Zhou](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=4C_OwWMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).  -->

My research interests lie in the Computer Vision and Generative Model. Specifically, I'm currently interested in **Controllable Text-to-Image Generation**, **Multi-modal Alignment**.

I'm an ACGN lover QAQ so I'm enthusiastic about the Image, Video, Music and Vocal Generation, especially the **model which have a good controllability**. My Ultimate goal is to build a model that can **Make Everybody be his/her Own Artist Easily**. If you have any idea or want to discuss/collaboration, feel free to contact me!

Previously, I've also been a member of the ZJU ACM/ICPC team, and I've reached a rating of **<span style="color:red">2478</span>** on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/epyset).
