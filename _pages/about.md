    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #34495e;">
      I'm a senior <strong>Computer Science</strong> student at <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/" style="color: #3498db;">Zhejiang University</a>, 
      pursuing an honors degree from the <a href="http://ckc.zju.edu.cn" style="color: #3498db;">Chu Kochen Honors College</a>. 
      Currently, I'm a research intern at <strong style="color: #e74c3c;">Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)</strong> lab, UC Berkeley, 
      working under the guidance of <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~xdwang/" style="color: #3498db;">Xudong Wang</a>

## 🔬 Research Focus

My research journey centers around **Computer Vision** and **Generative AI**. I'm particularly excited about building **Unified Multi-modal Models** that bridge the gap between text and image. My previous work has focused on **Controllable Text-to-Image Generation**, including Layout-to-Image synthesis and advanced Image Editing techniques.

See in my publication list [here](https://horizonwind2004.github.io/publications/).

Miscellaneous
-------------

I'm an ACGN lover, so I'm enthusiastic about the Image, Video, Music and Vocal Generation, especially the **model which have a good controllability**.

Previously, I've also been  a member of the ZJU ACM/ICPC team, and I've reached a rating of <span style="color:red">2478</span> on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/epyset). You can check my old blog [here](https://www.luogu.com.cn/user/77426). There are some old articles about my competitive programming experience :(.
