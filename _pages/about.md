About Me
======
Hi! I am a junior student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/)ï¼Œwith an honors degress from [Chu Kochen Honors College](ckc.zju.edu.cn). I currently hold a GPA of 93.6/100.0 and expect to receive my degree in June, 2026.

I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yi Yang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=RMSuNFwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and affiliated with the [RELER Lab](https://reler.net/), working closely with and [Zongxin Yang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=8IE0CfwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Dewei Zhou](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=4C_OwWMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My reasearch interests lie in the Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Specifically, I'm currently interested in **controllable text-to-image generation** and **multi-modal alignment**.

Previously, I've also been a member of the ZJU ACM/ICPC team, and I've reached a rating of **<span style="color:red">2478</span>** on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/epyset).
