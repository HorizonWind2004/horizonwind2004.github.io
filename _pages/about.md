# Hi ðŸ‘‹ ~

About Me
-----
I am a junior student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), pursuing a Bachelor of **Computer Science and Technology with an honors degree** from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn). I expect to receive my degree in June, 2026. I am a research intern at Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) lab, UC Berkeley, advised by [Xudong Wang](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~xdwang/) and [Prof. Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/). 

My research interests lie in the Computer Vision and Generative Model. Specifically, I'm currently interested in building **Unified Multi-modal Large Language Model**. Previously I worked heavily on **Controllable Text-to-Image Generation**, like Layout-to-Image Generation and Image Editing.

My Ultimate goal is to build a model that can **Make Everybody be his/her Own Artist Easily**. If you have any idea or want to discuss/collaboration, feel free to contact me!

Miscellaneous
------

I'm an ACGN lover QAQ so I'm enthusiastic about the Image, Video, Music and Vocal Generation, especially the **model which have a good controllability**.

Previously, I've also been  a member of the ZJU ACM/ICPC team, and I've reached a rating of **<span style="color:red">2478</span>** on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/epyset). You can check my old blog [here](https://www.luogu.com.cn/user/77426). There are some old articles about my competitive programming experience :(.
