# Hi ðŸ‘‹ ~

About Me
-----
I am a junior student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), pursuing a Bachelor of **Computer Science and Technology with an honors degree** from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn). I currently hold a GPA of 93.6/100.0 and expect to receive my degree in June, 2026.

I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yi Yang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=RMSuNFwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and affiliated with the [ReLER Lab](https://reler.net/), working closely with and [Dr. Zongxin Yang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=8IE0CfwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Dewei Zhou](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=4C_OwWMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My research interests lie in the Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Specifically, I'm currently interested in **Controllable Text-to-Image Generation**, **Multi-modal Alignment**.

I'm an ACGN lover QAQ so I'm enthusiastic about the Image, Video, Music, Vocal Generation, especially the Model which have a good controllability. My Ultimate goal is to build a model that can **Make Everybody be his/her Own Artist Easily**. If you have any idea or want to discuss/collaboration, feel free to contact me!

Previously, I've also been a member of the ZJU ACM/ICPC team, and I've reached a rating of **<span style="color:red">2478</span>** on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/epyset).
